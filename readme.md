**BubbleTree** is a library for interactive visualization of hierarchical data. Originally developed mainly for [spending data](http://openspending.org), the library is now completely independent from the OpenSpending platform. BubbleTree is built on top of [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [RaphaelJS](http://raphaeljs.com/).
